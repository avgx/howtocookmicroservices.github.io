As part of this update, we've added section about Continuous Delivery Pipeline. Also included simple **diagram that pictures first step of CD pipeline**: 

- building
- executing specs
- and distributing docker image for future operations.

Second part of this update includes **quick introduction to GOCD** and **why** we stick to this tool (comparing to Jenkins).

In the next update we'll add high-level diagram to picture full continous delivery pipeline from buidling an image to deploying it to remote environment!
