Added **4 minutes long screencast** to show how to easily run Ruby on Rails app with docker and docker compose.

In this video we:

- create docker host with virtualbox provider on the local
- build image for ruby on rails app
- launch ruby on rails app with docker-compose
- run specs for our app with docker-compose

Sorry for aspect ratio (promise to set resolution properly optimized for YouTube next time when recording on retina display! :D). Continuous improvement FTW

In series of next screencasts looking forward to cover quite a few topics:

- Introduction to Rancher - platform for orchestrating container infrastructure
- How to deploy Rancher and run rails app with Rancher on Digital Ocean
- How to use Rancher to automatically provision docker hosts and deploy feature branch to new hosts
